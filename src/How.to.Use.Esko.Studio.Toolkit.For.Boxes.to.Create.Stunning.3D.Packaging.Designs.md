## Step 1: Create a new document in Illustrator
 
Open Illustrator and create a new document with the following settings:
 
- Width: 200 mm
- Height: 200 mm
- Color Mode: CMYK
- Raster Effects: High (300 ppi)

You can also use any other dimensions or settings that suit your project.
 
## Step 2: Launch Esko Studio Toolkit For Boxes
 
In Illustrator, go to Window > Esko > Studio Toolkit For Boxes. A new panel will appear on the right side of your screen. This is where you can access all the features and options of Esko Studio Toolkit For Boxes.
 
## Step 3: Create a basic box shape
 
In the Esko Studio Toolkit For Boxes panel, click on the Create Basic Box button. A dialog box will pop up, where you can enter the dimensions and parameters of your box. For this example, we will use the following values:

- Length: 100 mm
- Width: 60 mm
- Height: 40 mm
- Front Panel: A
- Base Panel: B
- Glue Flap: Right
- Dust Flaps: Yes
- Tuck Flap: Yes
- Tuck Flap Length: 10 mm
- Tuck Flap Angle: 90Â°
- Tuck Flap Lock: No

You can also preview your box shape in 3D by clicking on the Preview button. When you are happy with your settings, click on OK. A new layer will be created in Illustrator with your box shape in 2D.
 
## Step 4: Apply your artwork to the box shape
 
Now you can apply your artwork to the box shape using Illustrator's tools and features. You can use any images, text, colors or effects that you want. For this example, we will use a simple logo and some text.
 
To apply your artwork to the box shape, you need to lock the layer that contains the box shape, and create a new layer above it for your artwork. Then, you can use the Selection tool (V) to select the parts of the box shape that you want to fill with your artwork, and copy them (Ctrl+C) and paste them in front (Ctrl+F) on the new layer. You can then use the Direct Selection tool (A) to adjust the anchor points and handles of the copied shapes to fit your artwork.
 
For example, to apply our logo to the front panel of the box, we select the front panel shape on the box layer, copy it and paste it in front on the artwork layer. Then, we adjust the anchor points and handles of the copied shape to match the size and position of our logo. We then fill the copied shape with our logo image using File > Place.
 
We repeat this process for each part of the box that we want to fill with our artwork. We also add some text using the Type tool (T) and some colors using the
